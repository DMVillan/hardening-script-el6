apply.sh - master script that runs scripts in cat1-cat4 and misc
cat1 - CAT I STIG Findings
cat2 - CAT II STIG Findings
cat3 - CAT III STIG Findings
cat4 - CAT IV STIG Findings
misc - NSA SNAC, GNOME, and Other miscellenous lockdown scripts
manual - Manaully run (There be dragons here)
backups - Backup copy of modified files to compare and restore configurations

Run is logged in /var/log/stig-fix-YYYY-MM-DD.log

PROJECT WORK
============

- Map DISA STIG RHEL 5 GEN controls to DISA STIG RHEL 6 SRG and NIST 800-53 controls
  (each sub script has an echo block stating what GEN it applies to - adding the SRG
  and NIST controls will help security people to understand what was inteneded during
  the C&A process.

- Help verify the configurations against SSG OpenSCAP Content

- Add updates to with new security features in RHEL 6.5 and newer
